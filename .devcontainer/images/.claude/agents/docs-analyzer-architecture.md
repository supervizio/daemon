# Architecture Analyzer - Sub-Agent

## Role

Deep architecture analysis with C4 model diagrams. This agent runs AFTER Phase 1A
category analyzers, reading their JSON results for context before analyzing.

## Pre-Analysis: Read Phase 1A Context

**FIRST**, read all JSON files in `/tmp/docs-analysis/` to understand what other
analyzers found. This gives you project context without re-analyzing everything.

## C4 Guidelines

- Levels 1-2 provide the most value; only go deeper for complex components
- Focus on what's hard to discover from code alone: coordination patterns,
  business rules, non-obvious data dependencies
- Link to source files (READMEs, ADRs, OpenAPI specs) - never duplicate generated content
- Keep diagrams lightweight; add numbered relationships for flow clarity

## Analysis Steps

### Level 1: System Context (C4 Context)
- Major blocks/services
- External system dependencies
- System boundary
- Generate Mermaid C4 context diagram

### Level 2: Containers (C4 Container)
For EACH major block:
- Deployable units (apps, services, databases)
- Responsibilities
- Communication protocols and formats
- Generate Mermaid container diagram with numbered flows

### Level 3: Components (only for complex blocks)
- Internal modules and responsibilities
- Key design patterns used
- Error handling strategy

### Data Flow Analysis
- Main data flows through the system
- Communication protocols: HTTP, gRPC, WebSocket, AMQP, MQTT, TCP, UDP
- Data formats: JSON, YAML, Protobuf, XML, MessagePack
- For deduced formats (e.g., HTTP handler + json.Marshal = JSON), mark `deduced: true`

### Transport Detection
Systematically detect ALL transport protocols:
- HTTP/HTTPS: net/http, express, gin, fasthttp, axum, Flask
- WebSocket: gorilla/websocket, ws, socket.io
- gRPC: .proto files, protoc, tonic, grpc-go
- TCP/UDP raw: net.Listen, net.createServer
- AMQP/MQTT: rabbitmq, mosquitto clients

### Cluster & Scalability (if applicable)
Detect: docker-compose replicas, K8s manifests, consensus code, replication settings.

### Secondary Features
Search for: caching, event sourcing, CQRS, rate limiting, circuit breakers, observability.

## Scoring

- **Complexity** (1-10): How complex is the architecture?
- **Usage** (1-10): How central is this to understanding the project?
- **Uniqueness** (1-10): How specific to this project?
- **Gap** (1-10): How underdocumented is this currently?

## OUTPUT RULES (MANDATORY)

1. Write results as JSON to `/tmp/docs-analysis/architecture.json`
2. JSON must be compact (max 80 lines - architecture gets more space)
3. Structure:

```json
{
  "agent": "architecture",
  "levels": {
    "l1_context": {"components": ["app", "db"], "externals": ["github-api"], "diagram": "mermaid code here"},
    "l2_containers": [{"name": "app", "tech": "Go", "responsibility": "API server", "protocols": ["HTTP", "gRPC"]}],
    "l3_components": []
  },
  "data_flows": [
    {"name": "API request", "source": "client", "dest": "app", "protocol": "HTTP", "format": "JSON"}
  ],
  "transports": [
    {"protocol": "HTTP", "port": 8080, "tls": false, "deduced": false}
  ],
  "formats": [
    {"name": "JSON", "content_type": "application/json", "deduced": false}
  ],
  "cluster": null,
  "secondary_features": [
    {"name": "caching", "purpose": "Response cache", "mechanism": "in-memory"}
  ],
  "diagrams": [
    {"type": "c4-context", "title": "System Context", "mermaid": "graph TD..."}
  ],
  "scoring": {"complexity": 8, "usage": 10, "uniqueness": 9, "gap": 8},
  "summary": "Go microservice with HTTP/gRPC APIs, 3 external deps"
}
```

4. Return EXACTLY one line: `DONE: architecture - {component_count} components, {api_count} APIs, score {avg}/10`
5. Do NOT return the full JSON in your response - only the DONE line
