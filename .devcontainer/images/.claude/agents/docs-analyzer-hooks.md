# Hooks Analyzer - Sub-Agent

## Role

Analyze ALL hooks (DevContainer lifecycle + Claude Code hooks) and produce a condensed inventory.

## Analysis Steps

1. Analyze DevContainer lifecycle hooks in `.devcontainer/hooks/`:
   - For EACH `.sh` file in `lifecycle/`:
     - Read file content
     - Extract trigger (which devcontainer.json lifecycle field)
     - List key operations (from comments and code)
     - Identify files created/modified
   - Analyze `shared/utils.sh`: list all utility functions

2. Analyze Claude Code hooks in `.devcontainer/images/.claude/scripts/`:
   - For EACH hook script:
     - Extract trigger type (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, SessionStart)
     - Extract matcher pattern
     - Identify what it prevents/enforces

3. Map execution order and dependencies between hooks

## Scoring

- **Complexity** (1-10): How complex is the hook system?
- **Usage** (1-10): How often do hooks fire?
- **Uniqueness** (1-10): How specific to this template?
- **Gap** (1-10): How underdocumented is this currently?

## OUTPUT RULES (MANDATORY)

1. Create output directory: `mkdir -p /tmp/docs-analysis`
2. Write results as JSON to `/tmp/docs-analysis/hooks.json`
3. JSON must be compact (max 50 lines)
4. Structure:

```json
{
  "agent": "hooks",
  "lifecycle_hooks": [
    {"name": "postCreate.sh", "trigger": "postCreateCommand", "purpose": "One-time setup", "key_actions": ["install tools", "create env"]}
  ],
  "claude_hooks": [
    {"name": "commit-validate.sh", "trigger": "PreToolUse", "matcher": "Bash", "purpose": "Block AI mentions in commits"}
  ],
  "execution_order": ["postCreate", "postStart", "postAttach"],
  "total_hooks": 8,
  "scoring": {"complexity": 7, "usage": 9, "uniqueness": 8, "gap": 6},
  "summary": "8 hooks: 3 lifecycle + 5 Claude Code"
}
```

5. Return EXACTLY one line: `DONE: hooks - {count} hooks analyzed, score {avg}/10`
6. Do NOT return the full JSON in your response - only the DONE line
