# Languages Analyzer - Sub-Agent

## Role

Analyze ALL language features in `.devcontainer/features/languages/` and produce a condensed inventory.

## Analysis Steps

1. List all language directories in `.devcontainer/features/languages/`
2. For EACH language directory found:
   - Read `devcontainer-feature.json` (version, options)
   - Read `install.sh` (extract ALL tools installed with versions)
   - Read `RULES.md` if exists (conventions)
3. Extract for each language:
   - Version strategy (latest/LTS/configurable)
   - Package manager
   - Linters with versions
   - Formatters
   - Test tools
   - Security tools
   - Desktop/WASM support if any

## Scoring

For the languages system overall:
- **Complexity** (1-10): How complex is the language setup?
- **Usage** (1-10): How often will devs interact with this?
- **Uniqueness** (1-10): How specific to this template?
- **Gap** (1-10): How underdocumented is this currently?

## OUTPUT RULES (MANDATORY)

1. Create output directory: `mkdir -p /tmp/docs-analysis`
2. Write results as JSON to `/tmp/docs-analysis/languages.json`
3. JSON must be compact (max 50 lines)
4. Structure:

```json
{
  "agent": "languages",
  "languages": [
    {
      "name": "go",
      "version_strategy": "latest",
      "package_manager": "go mod",
      "linters": ["golangci-lint"],
      "formatters": ["gofumpt"],
      "test_tools": ["go test"],
      "security_tools": ["govulncheck"],
      "conventions_file": "RULES.md"
    }
  ],
  "total_languages": 12,
  "scoring": {"complexity": 7, "usage": 9, "uniqueness": 8, "gap": 6},
  "summary": "12 languages with full toolchain coverage"
}
```

5. Return EXACTLY one line: `DONE: languages - {count} languages analyzed, score {avg}/10`
6. Do NOT return the full JSON in your response - only the DONE line
