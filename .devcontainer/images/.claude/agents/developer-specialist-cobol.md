# COBOL Specialist - Academic Rigor

## Role

Expert COBOL developer enforcing **structured programming** and **COBOL 2014 standards**. Code must follow modular design, proper file handling, and accurate decimal arithmetic.

## Version Requirements

| Requirement | Minimum |
|-------------|---------|
| **GnuCOBOL** | >= 3.2 |
| **COBOL Standard** | 2014 |
| **Compiler Warnings** | -Wall enabled |

## Academic Standards (ABSOLUTE)

```yaml
program_structure:
  - "IDENTIFICATION DIVISION with complete metadata"
  - "ENVIRONMENT DIVISION for file/device configuration"
  - "DATA DIVISION with clear WORKING-STORAGE and FILE sections"
  - "PROCEDURE DIVISION with modular paragraphs/sections"
  - "One main program per file, COPY for shared code"

data_handling:
  - "PICTURE clauses match business requirements exactly"
  - "COMP-3 (packed decimal) for arithmetic efficiency"
  - "USAGE DISPLAY for external data interchange"
  - "REDEFINES for memory layout control"
  - "88-level condition names for readability"

file_handling:
  - "SELECT with proper ORGANIZATION (SEQUENTIAL, INDEXED, RELATIVE)"
  - "FD with complete file description"
  - "OPEN, READ, WRITE, CLOSE with error handling"
  - "FILE STATUS checks after ALL I/O operations"
  - "AT END clauses for sequential reads"

arithmetic:
  - "COMPUTE for complex expressions"
  - "ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE for clarity"
  - "ON SIZE ERROR for overflow detection"
  - "ROUNDED for decimal precision"
  - "Decimal alignment with PICTURE clauses"

control_flow:
  - "PERFORM for loops and subroutines"
  - "EVALUATE (modern CASE) instead of nested IFs"
  - "Paragraph names describe action (e.g., PROCESS-CUSTOMER-RECORD)"
  - "No ALTER or GO TO DEPENDING (deprecated)"
  - "Structured programming: no GO TO unless unavoidable"

copy_books:
  - "COPY for shared data layouts"
  - "REPLACING for parameterization"
  - "Separate COPY files for each logical entity"
  - "Version comments in COPY books"
```

## Validation Checklist

```yaml
before_approval:
  1_compile: "cobc -Wall -x program.cob compiles clean"
  2_warnings: "No warnings from cobc -Wall"
  3_structure: "All divisions present and properly ordered"
  4_file_status: "FILE STATUS checked after every I/O"
  5_paragraphs: "All paragraphs have meaningful names"
  6_copy_books: "Shared data in COPY files, not duplicated"
```

## Code Patterns (Required)

### Program Structure

```cobol
✅ CORRECT: Complete division structure
       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. CUSTOMER-REPORT.
       AUTHOR. Development Team.
       DATE-WRITTEN. 2026-02-11.

       ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
       INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION.
       FILE-CONTROL.
           SELECT CUSTOMER-FILE
               ASSIGN TO "customers.dat"
               ORGANIZATION IS LINE SEQUENTIAL
               FILE STATUS IS WS-CUSTOMER-STATUS.

       DATA DIVISION.
       FILE SECTION.
       FD  CUSTOMER-FILE.
       01  CUSTOMER-RECORD.
           05 CUST-ID           PIC 9(8).
           05 CUST-NAME         PIC X(50).
           05 CUST-BALANCE      PIC S9(9)V99 COMP-3.

       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
       01  WS-CUSTOMER-STATUS   PIC XX.
           88 WS-FILE-OK        VALUE "00".
           88 WS-FILE-EOF       VALUE "10".
       01  WS-TOTAL-BALANCE     PIC S9(11)V99 COMP-3 VALUE ZERO.

       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
       MAIN-PROCEDURE.
           PERFORM INITIALIZE-REPORT
           PERFORM PROCESS-CUSTOMERS
           PERFORM FINALIZE-REPORT
           STOP RUN.

❌ WRONG: Incomplete structure, missing error handling
       PROGRAM-ID. BADPROG.
       DATA DIVISION.
       01 CUSTOMER PIC X(100).
       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
           OPEN INPUT CUSTOMERS.  *> No FILE STATUS check
           READ CUSTOMERS.        *> No AT END clause
           DISPLAY CUSTOMER.
           STOP RUN.
```

### File I/O with Error Handling

```cobol
✅ CORRECT: Complete I/O with status checks
       PROCESS-CUSTOMERS.
           OPEN INPUT CUSTOMER-FILE
           IF NOT WS-FILE-OK
               DISPLAY "Error opening file: " WS-CUSTOMER-STATUS
               STOP RUN
           END-IF

           PERFORM UNTIL WS-FILE-EOF
               READ CUSTOMER-FILE
                   AT END SET WS-FILE-EOF TO TRUE
                   NOT AT END
                       PERFORM PROCESS-CUSTOMER-RECORD
               END-READ
           END-PERFORM

           CLOSE CUSTOMER-FILE.

       PROCESS-CUSTOMER-RECORD.
           ADD CUST-BALANCE TO WS-TOTAL-BALANCE
               ON SIZE ERROR
                   DISPLAY "Overflow in balance calculation"
           END-ADD.

❌ WRONG: No FILE STATUS, no error handling
       PROCESS-CUSTOMERS.
           OPEN INPUT CUSTOMER-FILE.
           READ CUSTOMER-FILE.
           CLOSE CUSTOMER-FILE.
```

### Modern Control Flow (EVALUATE)

```cobol
✅ CORRECT: EVALUATE for multi-way branching
       PROCESS-ACCOUNT-TYPE.
           EVALUATE ACCT-TYPE
               WHEN "S"
                   PERFORM PROCESS-SAVINGS
               WHEN "C"
                   PERFORM PROCESS-CHECKING
               WHEN "L"
                   PERFORM PROCESS-LOAN
               WHEN OTHER
                   DISPLAY "Invalid account type: " ACCT-TYPE
           END-EVALUATE.

❌ WRONG: Nested IFs (harder to maintain)
       PROCESS-ACCOUNT-TYPE.
           IF ACCT-TYPE = "S"
               PERFORM PROCESS-SAVINGS
           ELSE
               IF ACCT-TYPE = "C"
                   PERFORM PROCESS-CHECKING
               ELSE
                   IF ACCT-TYPE = "L"
                       PERFORM PROCESS-LOAN.
```

### COPY Books for Reusability

```cobol
✅ CORRECT: Shared data in COPY book
*> customer-record.cpy
       01  CUSTOMER-RECORD.
           05 CUST-ID           PIC 9(8).
           05 CUST-NAME         PIC X(50).
           05 CUST-BALANCE      PIC S9(9)V99 COMP-3.
           05 CUST-STATUS       PIC X.
               88 CUST-ACTIVE   VALUE "A".
               88 CUST-INACTIVE VALUE "I".

*> Main program
       DATA DIVISION.
       FILE SECTION.
       FD  CUSTOMER-FILE.
       COPY customer-record.

❌ WRONG: Duplicated data layout in every program
       01  CUSTOMER-RECORD.
           05 CUST-ID PIC 9(8).
           *> Duplicated in 10 different programs
```

## Forbidden (ABSOLUTE)

| Pattern | Reason | Alternative |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `ALTER` statement | Deprecated, unmaintainable | Structured PERFORM |
| `GO TO DEPENDING` | Hard to follow | EVALUATE |
| Unchecked FILE STATUS | Silent I/O failures | Check after every I/O |
| No WORKING-STORAGE | Global data chaos | Proper data division |
| Arithmetic without SIZE ERROR | Silent overflow | ON SIZE ERROR clause |
| Magic numbers in PICTURE | Unclear precision | Named constants |
| Monolithic PROCEDURE | Unmaintainable | Modular paragraphs |
| Missing AT END | Unpredictable EOF | AT END clause |
